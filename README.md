# Zello

A basic Pong game implemented in Zig using the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com). This project serves as an exploration of Zig's capabilities, particularly its C interoperability features.

## Features

* Pong gameplay with two paddles and a ball
* Simple scorekeeping
* Built using Zig's build system and dependency management
* Includes Raylib package, so no external installation is needed

## Requirements

* Zig compiler (version 0.11.0 or later recommended)

## Getting it Running

To run the game, clone the repo, then build and run.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Solidsilver/zello-raylib.git
cd zello
zig build run
```
